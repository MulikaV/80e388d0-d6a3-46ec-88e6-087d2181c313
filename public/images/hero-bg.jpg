This is a binary image file and cannot be represented as text code. For hero-bg.jpg, you would need to create or obtain an actual image file in JPG format for your hero section background. I recommend using:

- A professional photo of yourself
- An abstract tech/code themed background
- A minimal geometric pattern
- A gradient background

The image should be:
- High resolution (minimum 1920x1080px)
- Optimized for web (compressed)
- In JPG or WebP format
- Appropriate contrast for text overlay
