Since placeholder.jpg is a binary image file, I cannot generate the actual binary content directly. Instead, I recommend using a real placeholder image like:

1. Create a 600x400px gray placeholder image
2. Save it as placeholder.jpg in public/images folder
3. Or use online placeholder services like https://placeholder.com/

Would you like me to suggest alternative approaches or help with a different file?
